# Lane Detection on CPU Pure Software
UDACITY Self Driving Car Advance Lane Detection project based Lane Detection Algorithms on C++. <br />

This project realized in C++ and OpenCV Library.<br />

### Project Repositories
1-) [Lane Detection with implementation on FPGA] <br />
**2-)** :heavy_check_mark::heavy_check_mark: **C++ with OpenCV on just CPU without any acceleration with FPGA:** Lane Detection on CPU Pure Software <br />
3.1-) **C++ with OpenCV on Arm processor and xfopencv on Hardware in Zynq-7000 series FPGA's, all steps of algorithms** [Lane Detection on FPGA-HW/SW part with SDSoC <br />
3.2-) **Verilog on hardware, only preprocess step:**  [Lane Detection on FPGA-HW part with VIVADO] <br />
