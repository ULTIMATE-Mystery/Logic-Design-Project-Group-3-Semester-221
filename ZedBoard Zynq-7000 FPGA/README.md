# Lane Detection with it's implementation on FPGA
Realization of 'Lane Detection' on CPU and implementation on FPGA using SDSOC and VIVADO. <br />

* Key terms for used softwares: C++, OpenCV, xfOpenCV, Verilog, Xilinx, Vivado, SdSoC. <br />

This project was realized in C ++ with OpenCV and was later implemented on FPGA using the xfOpenCV library. <br />
