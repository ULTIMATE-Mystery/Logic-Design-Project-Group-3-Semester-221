# Lane Detection on FPGA-HW/SW part with SDSoC
Realization of Advance Lane Detection Algorithm on Xilinx ZYNQ-7000 using SDSoC platform. <br />

This project realized in C++ using with OpenCV and xfOpenCV Libraries. <br />

### Project
1-) [Lane Detection with implementation on FPGA] <br />
2-) **C++ with OpenCV on just CPU without any acceleration with FPGA** [Lane Detection on CPU Pure Software] <br />
**3.1-)** :heavy_check_mark::heavy_check_mark: **C++ with OpenCV on Arm processor and xfopencv on Hardware in Zynq-7000 series FPGA's, all steps of algorithms**: Lane Detection on FPGA-HW/SW part with SDSoC <br />
3.2-) **Verilog on hardware, only preprocess step**  [Lane Detection on FPGA-HW part with VIVADO] <br />

## TODO
- Add project settings files <br />
